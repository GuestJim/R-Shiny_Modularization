Being self-taught at both R and Shiny, I rely heavily on the official documentation and official guides to learn how to do certain things and improve my work.
Unfortunately, I consider some of these references for Shiny to be poor to bad when it comes to the recommended way to modularize code.
For that reason, I have decide to compile what I have learned and uncovered over several months, into this guide, and attempt to address at least some of the weaknesses I have found in the reference materials.

As you can see I have created separate sections for this guide, including some "Advanced" portions at the end.
My intent is to have increasing complexity with the earlier sections but then for the "Advanced" sections to demonstrate some of the undocumented or poorly documented tricks I have found while solving specific problems.

I have only worked with Shiny 1.7+ and so this guide will also target that version level.
